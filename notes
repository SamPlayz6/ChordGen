Planning Thoughts:

Audio to MIDI -> https://github.com/tiagoft/audio_to_midi
              -> https://pypi.org/project/audio-to-midi/
Librosa (Maybe) -> https://librosa.org/doc/main/generated/librosa.midi_to_note.html

Generating Data:
Could sing lots of melodies. Generate alot of melody data.
After this then personally create chords for each melody. 
  -> Would produce a small dataset. Even if I put in a lot of work.
  -> Look into what dataset the BeatBoxing model used

Possible Datasets:

DATA BEING USED:

Currently using dataset - https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/





-----------------------------------------
To ask:

Go through ChordGen ideas flow. -> (Two problems: Audio to MIDI, MIDI Join)
Go through the model technical details

Show functionality and where it is going wrong -> Inference - On small dataset

--

ICHEC Application?
	- Quality of Abstract - How much?
	- What is an Application Case Document?
	- How to pick CPU Node Hours & GPU Node Hours & Large Memory Node Hours?

2500 Hours - Quick turn aorund time (Lukes Request)

Sam Request
1000 CPU Hours -> I should request
1000 GPU Hours -> I should request


MODEL: 
Things to change/Imagine:
  - Change the model so that padding is gone. Instead imagine it as one long time series. Where it learns to optimize that series of data
  - Change the training examples so no padding is added, this however means length can vary.
  - Change the model so it has padding but learns the weight of padding is 0 & cannot output in Inference.


Possible model detail changes:
  Change # Hidden Layers
  Change the optimization function (Something less central)
  Change the criterian function (The validation loss function checker)
